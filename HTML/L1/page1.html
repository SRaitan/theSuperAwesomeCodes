The 15 steps of the Seder are to be viewed as rungs in a ladder and are intended to move us toward a spiritual ascent on the night of Passover. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook was once asked, “Who is on a greater spiritual level, a person on a low rung or on a high rung of the spiritual ladder?” He answered: “It depends which direction the person is moving. If the person on the low rung is climbing and growing day by day, he/she is spiritually alive and engaged. Conversely, if a person on a high rung is moving downward, he/she has lost spiritual élan and may continue to sink.”</p>

Why is the night of Passover called Seder night? It hints to the idea that  everything that happens to us is not coincidence or happenstance. What we experience in our lives, in truth, has seder, ‘order’, even when it may not seem apparent to us. Our lives are overseen by the Master of the Universe. This truth we discover on Seder night. <strong>-Maharal of Prague</strong>

The Viznitzer Rebbe was asked why when burning the <em>chametz</em> we also burn the candle used in our search for the <em>chametz</em>. Certainly there is no suspicion of <em>chametz</em> adhering to it. He replied: This candle was used for one purpose only - to search for <em>chametz</em>. A candle whose sole existence is for the purpose of seeking out the negative must be burned.

The great Hasidic master, Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev, was puzzled as to why the Torah calls the festival the “Holiday of Matzah,” Chag HaMatzot, while we call the holiday Pesach, Passover. Why the discrepancy?
Rabbi Levi Yitzchak explained that these two terms represent God’s loving feeling for the Jewish people and the Jewish people’s loving feeling for God, each wanting to give full credit to the other for their act of love and faith.
Passover, Pesach, is a statement about God’s faith in us, passing over the homes of the Jewish people in Egypt and choosing us to be His people. We call the holiday Passover in recognition of this, and to show our thankfulness for God’s graciousness and kindness. By following God into the desert, the Jewish people showed an unwavering faith in their Maker. The Torah calls the holiday Chag HaMatzot, “Holiday of Matzah” suggesting that God “applauds” the Jewish people and “recognizes” their greatness and their faith in Him and going into the desert. God prefers to call the holiday by the name that credits the Jewish people for their faith and loyalty.
In this way, the two names of the holiday reflect the eternal faith of God in Israel and the eternal faith of Israel in God. Without both the Jewish people’s faith in God and God’s faith in the Jewish people we would have never survived to this day.
